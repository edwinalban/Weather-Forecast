# Weather-Forecast
5 Day Weather Forecast

## Description

I built this project for the purpose of practicing using Bootstrap, creating/manipulating elements in the DOM via JQuery, utilizing API calls/response data, and saving/updating elements based on user inputs. This project is focused primarily on the following:
Styling elements for responsive design via Bootstrap.
Creating elements in the DOM via JQuery.
Using the dayjs() method to convert unix/UTC timestamps to a date format.
Utilizing API calls to retreive data.
Manipulating dynamically created elements to display data from an API call response.
Saving/accessing updates to Local Storage
